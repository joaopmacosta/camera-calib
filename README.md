# camera-calib
Scripts to get the necessary parameters to calibrate cameras.

To build it do the following inside the repo folder:
>> cmake .
>> cmake --build .

To run it do:
>> ./run_calib_v1

WARNING: The calibration with picture is not implemented yet in the v1 version of the software. 
That's why there is another program called run_calib_w_pictures available to do that.
